A "incomplete" iOS jailbreak for 32-bit devices ( created by [iosusr](https://twitter.com/iosusr) )

Lets make a 32-Bit iOS 9.3.5 Jailbreak for all 32-Bit Devices

I'm trying to make [mach_portal](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=965) work on 32-bit devices.  

I'm also using [935csbypass](https://github.com/kpwn/935csbypass) by [@qwertyoruiopz](https://twitter.com/qwertyoruiopz). 

## Nalu meaning:

Nalu is the Hawaiian word for wave or surging surf, 
and the hapa-Hawaiian saying, to “Nalu it” means “go with the flow.” 
As every person who learns to swim in the ocean knows, 
you don't fight the waves, you ride them.
